# AOC_2025
Merry Christmas! This is my repo for all programming projects relating to advent of code 2025.


# Running solutions
Some of these solutions are written in Zig 0.15. 
You will need to install zig 0.15.2 and use `zig build run` inside a project folder. 
For my particular needs during development, I install the compiler inside each project folder and point vscode's settings.json to it. This allows for strict version control on my system. You may however find this tedous so the files were not included in version control.
